This sample code supports Calvin College
[CS 336](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden)
[Unit 11: Heroku](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden/11heroku/index.html).

The lab will upgrade the application from lab 10 to deploy to Heroku
using a git subtree branch. Look here for the
[running app](https://comments-kvlinden.herokuapp.com/).

We maintain this public version of the full repo because deploying from private
GitHub repos is tricky.
